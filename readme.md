# Falling-Ball: Realistic 3D Physics Simulation

This project showcases the fusion of technology and lifelike physics, allowing you to create balls that behave just like their real-world counterparts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Ball Creation:** Generate balls with a simple click on the canvas.
- **Gravity Simulation:** Watch balls fall naturally under the influence of gravity.
- **Realistic Bouncing:** Observe balls bounce convincingly upon collisions.
- **Smooth Rolling:** Witness balls roll naturally across the ground plane.
- **Immersive 3D Environment:** Enjoy a visually appealing 3D environment created using Three.js.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- [Cannon.js](https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/): A physics engine for simulating realistic physics interactions.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Core web technologies for building the interactive simulation.
